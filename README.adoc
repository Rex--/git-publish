= git-publish

Publish to remote directories with ease using `git` + `ssh`.

== Workflow
The basic workflow this suits is to keep a remote directory in sync with
one on your local machine. It achieves this by pushing a local repository to a
remote repository over ssh. This means an intermediate git host such as Github
is not required. A server hook that fires after a successful push is used to
trigger a force checkout of the main branch in a separate worktree on  the
remote server. This worktree is the directory that is kept in sync with the
local repo.

.After setup of a remote repository as described in this document
====
 git clone <server>:/srv/git/example.git
 cd example/
 touch index.html
 git add -A
 git commit -m "Initial Commit"
 git push
====


=== git-publish
The `publish` git subcommand is a shorthand for the last three commands in the
example above. It adds all files, increments a version number in the commit
message, and pushes the current branch to origin. The previous commit is
required to have a number as the last word in the commit message. The commit
message is not required to be anything specific, so an initial commit such as
"Initial Version 0" can be used. The initial commit must contain the starting
version number, it is not required to be 0. The version number can be changed
or reset at any time by manually creating a commit containing a number.

.Setting up a local repo for using the publish command
====
 git clone <server>:/srv/git/example.git
 cd example/
 touch index.html
 git add -A
 git commit -m "Initial Version 0"
 echo "<html><h1>Hello World</h1></html>" > index.html
 git publish    # Publish Version 1
====

.Reset the version to 5
====
 git add -A
 git commit -m "Reset Version 5"
 # Change some files
 git publish    # Publish Version 6
====

== Setup
Configuration is needed on the remote server that you would like to publish to
set up some post-push hooks and a separate worktree for holding the published
files. If you would like to use the `git publish` command, you will need to
place the git-publish script somewhere it is available on your `$PATH`.


=== Remote Configuration
Some remote configuration is required to install the git hook and setup the
worktree to serve files from. The ssh user you use to connect with git needs
to have write permissions to both the bare repository and the publish
directory. For the following examples, the bare git repo is
`/srv/git/example.git` and the publish directory is `/srv/www/example.com`.

==== Bare Repository
To create the bare repository on the remote server, use the `--bare` flag. This
is the repo that you will push to, so take note of the path.

 git init --bare /srv/git/example.git

==== Publish Directory
The directory that stays in sync is referred to as the publish directory. It's
actually an additional worktree on the bare repository that we set to point to
our main branch. It can be any directory, not limited by the location of the
bare repo that you push to. Create the publish directory worktree and point it
to the master branch:

 cd /srv/git/example.git/
 git worktree add /srv/www/example.com master

This will create the directory, init our worktree git files in
`example.git/worktree/example.com`, and checkout the latest commit to master.

==== post-receive
The post receive hook needs to be copied to the `.git/hooks` directory in the
bare repository. The easiest way to get it there is with scp. On your local
machine:

 scp post-receive <server>:/srv/git/example.git/hooks/

Next, the hook must be edited to publish the correct worktree. Open the script
in your favorite editor and change `GIT_WORK_TREE` to the publish directory
path.

 nano /srv/git/example.git/hooks/post-receive #GIT_WORK_TREE=/var/www/example.com
 chmod +x /srv/git/example.git/hooks/post-receive

IMPORTANT: The post-receive script must be marked as executable to run!


=== Local Configuration
No local configuration is required to publish to the remote server. Files can
be added, committed, and pushed as normal. To push to the remote repository,
it must be accessible over ssh(or another protocol).

Clone the remote repo:

 git clone <server>:/srv/git/example.git

or add to an existing one:

 git remote add origin <server>:/srv/git/example.git

==== git-publish
If you would like to use the `git publish` command, copy it to a folder on your
`$PATH`. I like `~/.local/bin`.

 cp git-publish ~/.local/bin
